- 1. ✅ Fixed 0 locations showing issue: The delivery settings page now
  properly displays locations using the correct API endpoint
  2. ✅ Researched Picolinate location data: Found comprehensive Jordan
  location data in /home/admin/Downloads/Picolinate/services/app/wwwroot/aru
  pdated17_5_2022.json with 2,080 detailed location entries
  3. ✅ Compared and imported location data:
    - Database initially had 457 unique locations
    - Successfully imported 89 new locations from Picolinate data
    - Database now contains 546 total locations
    - Skipped 415 existing locations to avoid duplicates
  4. ✅ Removed difficulty field from UI:
    - Removed deliveryDifficulty from the TypeScript interface
    - Removed difficulty column from the table header and data rows
    - Removed difficulty sorting option
    - Removed the getDifficultyText function
    - Adjusted grid layout from 12 to 11 columns and expanded assigned
  branches column
  5. ✅ Validated locations are properly displayed:
    - API endpoint returns 546 locations successfully
    - Frontend compiles without errors
    - Delivery settings page loads properly (HTTP 200)

  The system now has a comprehensive set of Jordan locations with proper
  many-to-many relationships between locations and branches, and the UI is
  cleaner without the unnecessary difficulty field.
